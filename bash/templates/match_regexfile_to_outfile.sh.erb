# Explanation:
#  1. sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n/\\n/g' : translates actual newlines in regex file into literal "\n" strings to form one very long regex. Doing this keeps pcregrep from interpeting newlines as pattern delimiters. Otherwise pcregrep would assume there are multiple patterns to search for in the file instead of trying to match one big pattern.
# Call pcregrep in multi line mode, returning 0 if entire regex is found, 1 otherwise
